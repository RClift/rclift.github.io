                <p>My name is Richard Clift and I am going to school at Portland State University while pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
                    I am near the end of my degree and through my years of schooling I have had the opportunity to experience a good number of different
                    coding languages.  Over the years I have had varying amounts of experience with Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, C++, C#, and Python.
                </p>
                <p>In my free time I like to play video games and tabletop RPGs.  I typically play a lot of JRPG video games but recently I have been
                    having a lot of fun play The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and using unintended techniques such as Wind Bombing to move around
                    quickly.

                <h3>PhoneBill Project</h3>
                <p>For my CS410J, Advanced Programming in Java, class I have been working on a project that stores information for different phone calls in a phone
                    bill.  Throughout the process we have been adding additional functionality to the project.  It began simply by taking in information from the
                    command line as well as a few options such as printing out the call or viewing a readme that has all of the information of how to use the program.
                    As the project has been built up options and functionality has been added for interacting with files, date and text formatting, interacting with
                    a servlet for web support, and culminating with a simple apllication that works on android devices.

                <h3>HW3 and Bootstrap</h3>
                <p>For CS410, Intro to Web Development, I have been working on learning fundamental elements of HTML and CSS.  In this part the focus was on ways
                    to format blocks of elements and the different methods to display these items.  One of the more interesting elements worked on was through 
                    the use of bootstrap which makes use of 12 columns that the displayed area is divided into evenly.
