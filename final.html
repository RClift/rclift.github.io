                <p>My name is Richard Clift and I am going to school at Portland State University while pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
                    I am near the end of my degree and through my years of schooling I have had the opportunity to experience a good number of different
                    coding languages.  Over the years I have had varying amounts of experience with Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, C++, C#, and Python.
                </p>
                <p>In my free time I like to play video games and tabletop RPGs.  I typically play a lot of JRPG video games but recently I have been
                    having a lot of fun play The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and using unintended techniques such as Wind Bombing to move around
                    quickly.
